# WF1 Plan — Hiếu

**Owner**: Hiếu
**Flow**: WF1 — Assets and Periodic Scheduling
**Jira Epic**: `SCRUM-54`
**Capacity**: 17 planned days + 3 reserve days

## Outcome

Client asset and schedule actions produce one organization-scoped periodic request. The flow
must pass the G2 handoff and its negative authorization cases.

## Owner tasks

- `T005`–`T006` — Admin catalog and organization-scoped asset APIs.
- `T007`–`T008` — Client asset screens and authorized document upload.
- `T009`–`T010` — schedule lifecycle and durable due-cycle event.
- `T011` — schedule and catalog web screens.
- `T012`–`T013` — WF1→WF2 handoff, security regression, and flow documentation.

## Delivery windows

| Jira sprint | Dates | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W3 — Foundation & DB | Sep 28–Oct 2 | Catalog and asset API |
| W4 — WF1 & WF2 Core | Oct 5–9 | Schedule lifecycle, due event, handoff test |
| W5 — WF3 & WF4 Core | Oct 12–16 | Asset/document and catalog/schedule web UI |
| W6 — Integration & Demo | Oct 19–23 | Regression, documentation, integration support |

## Handoff and acceptance

- Publish one idempotent due-cycle event per asset, schedule, and cycle.
- Consumer WF2 creates at most one `PERIODIC` request for a replayed event.
- Reject inactive assets, unavailable checklists, duplicate codes, and cross-organization access.
- G2 is green before the integrated five-role demo.
