### 3.2 FE-01 Identity and Access Governance

FE-01 provides Client organization self-registration, authentication, account and profile management, role- and scope-based authorization, session management, and audit logging. A Client registration creates one active organization and its first Client account; it cannot create platform or service-workforce roles. Backend authorization remains authoritative for organization, ownership, assignment, release, and separation-of-duties scope.

#### 3.2.1 Identity, Session and Authorization Rules

- All users sign in through the versioned authentication API. The browser keeps access tokens in memory, uses the protected refresh-cookie flow, and does not persist credentials in browser storage.
- Mobile authentication uses the mobile token-delivery contract and secure platform storage.
- Admin manages platform identities and role assignments. Client self-registration creates only the Client role.
- Logout, password change, disable, role change, and session revocation invalidate affected active sessions.
- Authentication and authorization events are auditable without storing passwords, raw tokens, or protected evidence content.

### 3.3 FE-02 Asset Registry and Inspection Schedule

FE-02 lets a Client manage the assets and recurring inspection schedules belonging to the Client's organization. Admin maintains the categories and checklist templates used by the feature.

#### 3.3.1 Manage Assets and Periodic Inspection Scheduling

**Function trigger:** The Client opens Asset Management to register an asset or opens Inspection Schedules for an existing active asset.

**Function description:**

- The Client enters the asset code, name, category, location, technical description, operational status, and available documents.
- The system verifies that the Client belongs to the asset's organization and that the asset code is unique within that organization.
- The Client selects a checklist template, recurrence rule, next due date, preferred inspection window, and responsible contact.
- The system validates the recurrence rule and activates the schedule only when the asset and checklist template are active.
- On each due cycle, the system creates one periodic inspection request and records the Asset, Schedule, and Due Cycle key.

**Validation and exception requirements:** Missing required asset data prevents activation. An inactive asset pauses its schedule. An unavailable checklist routes the due request to manual review. Retrying the scheduler cannot create a duplicate request for the same due cycle.

**Result:** A valid periodic inspection request enters the request-review process.

### 3.4 FE-03 Inspection Request and Work Assignment

FE-03 manages periodic and ad hoc inspection requests, commercial review, quotation and order versions, Client approval, and Inspector assignment.

#### 3.4.1 Review Request and Assign Inspector

**Function trigger:** A periodic request is generated or the Client submits an ad hoc inspection request.

**Function description:**

- The Client completes scope, priority, preferred deadline, site-access constraints, contact information, and supporting documents.
- The system verifies organization ownership, required fields, attachment references, and valid status transitions.
- The Service Manager assesses completeness, feasibility, required checklist, duration, service capacity, and delivery expectations.
- The Service Manager creates a versioned quotation and draft service order. A revision creates a new version and preserves earlier versions.
- The Client approves the current version and accepts post-service payment terms or requests revision.
- After approval, the Service Manager selects a qualified and available Inspector and sends the assignment package.
- The Inspector accepts or rejects. Rejection requires a reason and returns the request to the Service Manager for reassignment.

**Validation and exception requirements:** An unconfirmed service order cannot be assigned. The system prevents assignment to an inactive user and records known conflict checks. Only an accepted assignment can enter inspection execution.

**Result:** The service order is confirmed and the inspection is `READY_FOR_INSPECTION` with an accepted Inspector assignment.

### 3.5 FE-04 Inspection Execution and Evidence Management

FE-04 provides the assigned Inspector's inspection session, checklist execution, evidence intake, metadata, checksum, duplicate prevention, retry behavior, and authorized MinIO storage.

#### 3.5.1 Execute Inspection and Upload Evidence

**Function trigger:** The assigned Inspector opens an accepted assignment and starts the inspection session.

**Function description:**

- The system records the start time, responsible Inspector, asset, confirmed scope, and checklist version.
- The assigned Inspector can retrieve the published checklist and saved responses through `GET /api/v1/inspections/{inspectionId}/checklist`; checklist responses are saved through the inspection-scoped API and remain attributable to the authenticated Inspector.
- The Inspector performs the field inspection according to the confirmed scope. Manual drone piloting remains outside the platform.
- The Inspector uploads images and documents. The backend validates type and size, calculates a checksum, prevents duplicate records, and stores authorized content in MinIO.
- Web and mobile uploads use the same inspection-scoped API. Available capture time, source (`WEB_UPLOAD`, `MOBILE_UPLOAD`, `SD_CARD`, or `IMPORTED`), GPS, and external reference are stored as metadata. Missing GPS is recorded but does not automatically invalidate evidence.

**Validation and exception requirements:** Unsupported or corrupted files are rejected. Interrupted uploads retry without duplicate evidence records. An Inspector cannot update another Inspector's assignment without a separate authorized role and scope.

**Result:** The inspection has a session record, completed checklist responses, and traceable evidence ready for finding verification.

### 3.6 FE-05 YOLO-Assisted Defect Detection and Verification

FE-05 generates non-official defect candidates from eligible inspection images and requires human verification before findings are used in reports or statistics.

#### 3.6.1 AI Candidate Generation and Review

**Function trigger:** An eligible evidence image is available after upload validation.

**Function description:**

- When YOLO inference is enabled, the configured service receives only eligible authorized images and returns a candidate label, confidence, bounding box, and model version. If inference is disabled or unavailable, evidence remains available and the Inspector can add a manual finding.
- The Inspector reviews every candidate and chooses Confirm, Modify, or Reject.
- The Inspector may manually add a finding that the AI service did not detect.
- Only confirmed, modified, or manually added findings enter official statistics and report content.

**Validation and exception requirements:** AI failure does not discard evidence or prevent manual finding entry. Rejected or unverified candidates remain non-official. An Inspector cannot verify findings outside the assigned inspection scope.

**Result:** The inspection has traceable, Inspector-verified findings that can be used by FE-06.

### 3.7 FE-06 Inspection Report and Approval

FE-06 compiles versioned inspection reports from checklist responses, evidence, and Inspector-verified findings, then controls peer review, Service Manager release, and Client acceptance.

#### 3.7.1 Review and Release Inspection Report

**Function trigger:** The Inspector completes the checklist and required finding details.

**Function description:**

- The system compiles a report draft from checklist responses, evidence, verified findings, and recommendations.
- The Inspector reviews and corrects the draft and submits a version for peer review.
- The Service Manager assigns another qualified Inspector. The author cannot review or technically approve the same report.
- The peer reviewer verifies evidence support, classification, severity, location, checklist consistency, and conclusions.
- When changes are required, the author creates a revised version and resubmits it. Prior versions and review decisions remain traceable.
- When technically approved, the Service Manager checks deliverable completeness and releases the report to the Client.
- The Client accepts the report or requests clarification or revision without editing technical content directly.
- The Client decision is recorded against the released version with the authenticated Client actor; a revision request also retains its reason. A revision request does not remove the released version from the Client's organization-scoped history.
- When the Client accepts the report, the system makes that version immutable, transitions the owning inspection to `COMPLETED`, and publishes one accepted-report handoff for the separately owned billing workflow. That workflow records the inspection billing milestone and creates or issues the invoice according to the confirmed post-service payment terms. No online payment gateway is required in the first release.
- The Inspector may request an on-demand AI-assisted narrative draft for a version in `DRAFT` status. The draft is generated from the version snapshot (checklist, findings, and evidence metadata without GPS/PII) and stored as the pending narrative pending human review. The Inspector reviews and edits the draft through the narrative endpoint before submitting the version for peer review. Generating a new AI draft replaces any existing narrative on that version; the narrative endpoint is the final human correction step before peer review, so the last write wins.

**Validation and exception requirements:** Internal drafts and peer-review comments are not customer-visible. A released report cannot be silently overwritten. An accepted version is immutable; later corrections create a new linked version.

**Result:** A technically reviewed, customer-visible, and accepted inspection report is available for maintenance decisions.

### 3.8 FE-07 Maintenance and Defect Resolution

FE-07 links verified findings from accepted reports to maintenance assessment, approved work, controlled change requests, completion evidence, release, resolution, rework, and re-inspection.

#### 3.8.1 Create and Assess Maintenance Ticket

**Function trigger:** The Client selects one or more verified findings from an accepted report and creates a maintenance ticket.

**Function description:**

- The system links the ticket to the Client organization, asset, accepted report, selected findings, and supporting evidence.
- The Client supplies priority, preferred deadline, access constraints, contact information, and additional instructions.
- The Service Manager reviews completeness and decides whether assessment can be remote or requires a site visit.
- The Service Manager assigns a qualified Maintenance Engineer for assessment; this assignment does not authorize execution work.
- The Engineer records the condition, required work, materials, labor, duration, risks, assumptions, and estimated cost range.

**Validation and exception requirements:** A ticket must reference at least one verified finding. The selected finding must belong to the Client's organization. The Engineer must accept the assessment assignment before submitting the assessment.

**Result:** A traceable technical assessment is ready for commercial preparation.

#### 3.8.2 Prepare and Approve Maintenance Work

**Function trigger:** The Maintenance Engineer submits the technical assessment.

**Function description:**

- The Service Manager creates a versioned maintenance quotation and draft maintenance order from the assessment and approved pricing rules.
- The order identifies scope, deliverables, exclusions, estimated duration, cost or rates, assumptions, and post-service payment terms.
- The Client approves the current version or requests revision.
- After approval, the Service Manager confirms the order and assigns the same or another qualified Maintenance Engineer for execution.
- The Engineer accepts or rejects the execution assignment; rejection requires a reason and returns the work for reassignment.

**Validation and exception requirements:** The Service Manager cannot replace the Engineer's technical assessment with an unsupported estimate. An unapproved order cannot proceed to execution. No upfront payment is required.

**Result:** An approved maintenance order and accepted execution assignment are ready for work.

#### 3.8.3 Execute Work and Manage Change

**Function trigger:** The assigned Maintenance Engineer opens an accepted execution assignment.

**Function description:**

- The Engineer records start time, work progress, materials, labor time, and approved tasks.
- Before and after evidence is uploaded through the authorized file flow and linked to the work log.
- If additional damage or material cost growth is discovered, the Engineer stops the additional work and submits a change request.
- The Service Manager creates a revised order version from the technical change information.
- The Client approves or rejects the change before additional work continues.
- The Engineer completes the approved scope and submits actual duration, materials, final cost, evidence, and completion notes.

**Validation and exception requirements:** Work outside the approved scope is prohibited until the change is approved. Rejected changes remain in history and do not alter the current approved order. Completion requires before/after evidence and a complete work log.

**Result:** A maintenance completion report is ready for internal verification.

#### 3.8.4 Release and Resolve Maintenance Result

**Function trigger:** The Maintenance Engineer submits completion information.

**Function description:**

- The Service Manager compares completion evidence and final cost with the approved order and approved change versions.
- When complete, the Service Manager releases the maintenance result to the Client.
- The Client chooses Accept Resolution, Request Rework, or Request Re-inspection.
- Accept Resolution closes the ticket and linked defect and allows invoice and payment status tracking.
- When the Client accepts the maintenance result, the system finalizes the actual cost and creates or issues the maintenance invoice according to the confirmed post-service payment terms. The invoice follows the same payment-status lifecycle as an inspection invoice.
- Request Rework returns the ticket to execution with a documented reason and a new work cycle.
- Request Re-inspection creates a linked ad hoc inspection request and returns it to WF2.

**Validation and exception requirements:** Only a released result can receive a Client decision. Closing a ticket preserves the assessment, order versions, assignments, work logs, evidence, decisions, and audit history.

**Result:** The ticket is closed, returned for rework, or linked to a new inspection request.

### 3.9 FE-08 Dashboard, Analytics and Notifications

FE-08 provides role- and scope-filtered dashboards, operational summaries, defect and service analytics, asset history, workload visibility, and workflow notifications. The feature does not expose data outside the authenticated user's organization, ownership, assignment, or release scope.

#### 3.9.1 Scoped Dashboard and Analytics

- Admin views platform-level operational and audit summaries allowed by the platform policy.
- Service Manager views request, assignment, review, deadline, report, maintenance, and payment-status summaries for authorized service operations.
- Client views the organization's assets, requests, released reports, maintenance tickets, and invoice or payment status.
- Inspector and Maintenance Engineer view assigned work queues, deadlines, evidence status, and relevant history.

#### 3.9.2 Workflow Notifications

- The system notifies the next responsible actor after material assignments, review decisions, releases, correction requests, deadlines, and Client decisions.
- Notifications do not grant access; every linked page and API request applies the normal authorization and resource-scope checks.
