## 2. Database Design

The relational database is implemented on PostgreSQL 17 with the `pgvector` extension. The schema enforces referential integrity through foreign keys, tenant and role isolation, and optimistic concurrency control. It supports four main business areas:

- **Onboarding, Assets, and Drone Registry (MF1)**: Customer organizations, user accounts, Inspector profiles and flight logs, one-time verification challenges, customer airspace registration reviews, infrastructure assets, asset documents, and Inspector-owned drone registrations.
- **Commercial Requests, Quotations, and Agreements (MF2)**: One-time and recurring service requests, order chat messages, versioned VND quotations, scheduled inspection occurrences, and platform financial rate settings.
- **Field Inspections, Evidence, and Reporting (MF3)**: Inspection missions, on-site field sessions, photograph and video evidence, AI and confirmed defect findings, versioned inspection reports, and three-way re-inspection defect verifications.
- **Corrective Maintenance and Closeout (MF4)**: Maintenance work orders, repair teams, tasks, cost estimates, cost lines, change orders, work logs, completion reports, customer acceptance decisions, and engineering standard knowledge chunks.

**Domain Entity State Machine Diagrams**

**1. Service Request and Payment State Machines**

```mermaid
%% title: Service Request and Occurrence Payment State Machine Diagram
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  state "Service Request Lifecycle" as ReqSM {
    [*] --> OPEN : Submit Request
    OPEN --> QUOTED : Issue VND Quotation
    QUOTED --> QUOTED : Revise Quotation Version
    QUOTED --> ACCEPTED : Customer Accepts Quote
    ACCEPTED --> CONTRACT_SIGNED : Upload Signed Agreement
    CONTRACT_SIGNED --> ASSIGNED : Dispatch Inspector & Drone
    OPEN --> CANCELLED : Cancel Request
    QUOTED --> CANCELLED : Cancel Request
    ASSIGNED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]
  }

  state "Occurrence Payment Lifecycle" as PaySM {
    [*] --> PENDING : Occurrence Created
    PENDING --> PAYMENT_DUE : Customer Accepts Report
    PAYMENT_DUE --> PAID : Online Payment Confirmed
    PAID --> [*]
  }
```

| Domain Entity | Lifecycle States | Key Transition Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Customer & Drone Onboarding** | `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED` | Locations inside a prohibited No-Fly Zone are rejected immediately; restricted airspace locations remain pending until reviewed by an Administrator or Manager. Drone registration requires all three supporting documents before approval. |
| **Service Request** | `OPEN`, `QUOTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `CONTRACT_SIGNED`, `ASSIGNED`, `CANCELLED` | Accepting a quotation materializes the planned inspection occurrences. Uploading the signed offline agreement moves the request to the contract-signed state so occurrences can be dispatched. |
| **Occurrence Payment & Payout** | Payment: `PENDING`, `PAYMENT_DUE`, `PAID`<br>Payout: `PENDING`, `ELIGIBLE`, `PAID` | Customer acceptance of a published report makes payment due for that occurrence. Confirmed payment via PayOS or VNPay marks the occurrence as paid and records Inspector payout settlement. |

**2. Inspection, Field Session, and Inspection Report State Machines**

```mermaid
%% title: Inspection and Field Session State Machine Diagram
stateDiagram-v2
  direction TB
  [*] --> SCHEDULED : Dispatch Inspector & Drone
  SCHEDULED --> IN_PROGRESS : Start Field Session (Flight Permit Required)
  IN_PROGRESS --> SCHEDULED : Abort Session (Notify Manager)
  IN_PROGRESS --> FIELD_COMPLETED : Complete Field Session
  FIELD_COMPLETED --> UNDER_REVIEW : Submit Inspection Report
  UNDER_REVIEW --> FIELD_COMPLETED : Return or Withdraw Report
  UNDER_REVIEW --> COMPLETED : Approve & Publish Report
  SCHEDULED --> CANCELLED : Cancel Inspection
  COMPLETED --> [*]
  CANCELLED --> [*]
```

```mermaid
%% title: Inspection Report Version State Machine Diagram
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  [*] --> SUBMITTED : Submit Compiled Report
  SUBMITTED --> RETURNED : Manager Returns or Author Withdraws
  RETURNED --> SUBMITTED : Resubmit Updated Report
  SUBMITTED --> PUBLISHED : Independent Manager Approves & Publishes Report
  PUBLISHED --> SUPERSEDED : Newer Version Published
  PUBLISHED --> [*]
  SUPERSEDED --> [*]
```

| Domain Entity | Lifecycle States | Key Transition Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inspection Mission** | `SCHEDULED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `FIELD_COMPLETED`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED` | A field session can start only when the mission is scheduled and a flight permit is on file. Once a session completes, no additional field session can be started; the Inspector proceeds to evidence review and report submission. |
| **Field Session** | `PLANNED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `FIELD_COMPLETED`, `ABORTED` | Starting a session requires a pre-flight safety note, and completing a session requires outcome notes. Aborting a session records the abort reason, reverts the mission to scheduled, and alerts the Manager to reschedule, reassign, or cancel. |
| **Defect Finding** | `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED` | AI-detected defect candidates start as pending. All pending candidates must be confirmed or removed by the assigned Inspector before the findings baseline can be locked. |
| **Inspection Report** | `SUBMITTED`, `RETURNED`, `PUBLISHED`, `SUPERSEDED` | A qualified Manager or Administrator other than the author either returns a submitted report with a reason or approves and publishes it in one action. Publication marks the report version official and immutable and completes the inspection. |

**3. Maintenance Work Order State Machine**

```mermaid
%% title: Maintenance Work Order Lifecycle State Machine Diagram
stateDiagram-v2
  direction TB
  [*] --> DRAFT : Create Work Order from Defect
  DRAFT --> AWAITING_APPROVAL : Submit Cost Estimate
  AWAITING_APPROVAL --> APPROVED : Customer Approves Estimate
  AWAITING_APPROVAL --> REWORK_REQUIRED : Customer Rejects Estimate
  REWORK_REQUIRED --> AWAITING_APPROVAL : Submit Revised Estimate
  APPROVED --> READY : Release Work Order
  READY --> IN_PROGRESS : Start Field Repair
  IN_PROGRESS --> WORK_COMPLETED : Complete Repair (All Work Logs Verified)
  WORK_COMPLETED --> SUBMITTED_FOR_ACCEPTANCE : Submit Completion Report
  SUBMITTED_FOR_ACCEPTANCE --> ACCEPTED : Customer Accepts Repair
  SUBMITTED_FOR_ACCEPTANCE --> REWORK_REQUIRED : Customer Requests Rework
  SUBMITTED_FOR_ACCEPTANCE --> REINSPECTION_REQUIRED : Customer Requests Drone Re-inspection
  REWORK_REQUIRED --> IN_PROGRESS : Resume Repair Work
  REINSPECTION_REQUIRED --> REINSPECTION_REPORT_ATTACHED : Re-inspection Report Published
  REINSPECTION_REPORT_ATTACHED --> ACCEPTED : Customer Accepts After Re-inspection
  REINSPECTION_REPORT_ATTACHED --> REWORK_REQUIRED : Customer Requests Further Rework
  ACCEPTED --> COST_RECONCILED : Reconcile Actual Costs
  COST_RECONCILED --> CLOSED : Close Work Order
  CLOSED --> [*]
```

| Domain Entity | Lifecycle States | Key Transition Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Maintenance Work Order** | `DRAFT`, `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, `READY`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `WORK_COMPLETED`, `SUBMITTED_FOR_ACCEPTANCE`, `ACCEPTED`, `REWORK_REQUIRED`, `REINSPECTION_REQUIRED`, `COST_RECONCILED`, `CLOSED` | The Customer budget approver and accepting reviewer must be independent of the executing repair team. Requesting a drone re-inspection creates a linked re-inspection mission and attaches its published report back to the work order. |
| **Estimate & Change Order** | `DRAFT`, `SUBMITTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `SUPERSEDED` | A work order cannot be declared complete while any change order is awaiting approval. Approved change orders adjust the authorized budget ceiling without overwriting the original estimate. |
| **Maintenance Work Log** | `IN_PROGRESS`, `PAUSED_FOR_CHANGE`, `SUBMITTED`, `VERIFIED` | Every submitted work log must be verified by the designated Team Lead before the work order can be declared complete. |
