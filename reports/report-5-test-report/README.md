# Report 5 — Test Report working folder

This folder separates the contents of the supplied `Report5_Test Report.xlsx`
template so the team can update test cases without repeatedly rebuilding the
whole workbook.

**Scope and status (updated 2026-11-11):** The current Report 5 inventory contains **52 active test cases** across 6 product features (`FE-01`–`FE-06`, mapped 1-to-1 to `Feature 1`–`Feature 6`) aligned with Flyway `V1`–`V29` and 39 application tables. WF3-020 covers non-MAVLink log import/manual declaration and remains Pending in Round 3. Current-scope Round 1 totals are 45 `Passed`, 0 `Failed`, 4 `Pending`, and 3 `N/A`. The active-scope historical subtotal is 49 cases (45 Passed, 4 Pending); original eight-feature results are historical and not current coverage. Round 3 includes four Passed cases (`WF3-006`, `WF3-016`, `WF3-018`, `WF3-019`); the last two are the V29 subset. V29 schema, persistence, payment lifecycle, PayOS, and VNPay tests passed on 2026-11-05; this change's flight-log/parser checks are reported separately and not marked as an executed Report 5 round.

The original workbook template remains unchanged; generated copies contain six active feature sheets (`Feature 1`–`Feature 6`). Maintenance feature sheets and cases are retired historical material, not current coverage.

## Naming layers and mapping

The supplied template has two feature sheets (`Feature 1`, `Feature 2`). Generated
workbooks extend it to six active feature sheets (`Feature 1`–`Feature 6`), one per
current Report 3 feature (`FE-01`–`FE-06`). Sheet `Feature N` contains SRS feature `FE-0N`.

| Layer | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workbook sheet | Generated Report 5 grouping; one sheet per FE | `Feature 6` |
| SRS feature | Product capability from Report 3 | `FE-06 — Evidence Intake, YOLO11 Detection, Auto-Compiled Report & PayOS` |
| WF test ID | Business-flow traceability ID | `WF3-005` |

## Source of truth and template rule

- `template/Report5_Test Report.xlsx` is an unchanged copy of the supplied
  workbook. Do not edit this copy to add new sections or rename sheets.
- Exactly six active FE-specific Markdown files in `03-features/` are the editable
  feature sources (`fe-01` through `fe-06`). Keep test case IDs stable when a
  case is reworded or re-tested.
- When the report is ready for submission, use the exporter to produce a copy
  of the official template with six generated feature sheets. Read
  [template-layout.md](template-layout.md) first: it carries the exact cell
  addresses, the per-sheet summary block, and the template defects that will
  otherwise corrupt an export.

| `template-layout.md` | All sheets | Exact sheet, column, and section reference. |
| `template/Report5_Test Report.xlsx` | All sheets | Original-format workbook copy. |

The `FE-01`–`FE-06` codes and their Report 3 sections are:

| FE | Report 3 § | Report 3 feature title | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FE-01` | `3.2` | Authentication, Google OAuth2 & 5-Role Access Control | Trần Hoàng Trung Hiếu (`SE184212`) |
| `FE-02` | `3.3` | Partner Onboarding, Workforce, Asset & Inspector Drone Registry | Trần Hoàng Trung Hiếu (`SE184212`) |
| `FE-03` | `3.4` | Recurring Service Requests, Contract Occurrences & Outbox Notifications | Phùng Trung Quốc (`SE170027`) |
| `FE-04` | `3.5` | Service Requests, Quotations, Contracts, Dispatch & Airspace Map | Phùng Trung Quốc (`SE170027`) |
| `FE-05` | `3.6` | Flight Permit Gate, Field Execution, Dashboard & Calendar | Trần Tùng Bách (`SE180220`) |
| `FE-06` | `3.7` | Evidence Intake, YOLO11 Detection, Auto-Compiled Report & PayOS | Trần Tùng Bách (`SE180220`) |

Each active FE file's H1 carries its current Report 3 title. Retired maintenance case sources are removed from the active suite.

## Editing workflow

1. Add or update the case in its owning active FE-specific file first (`fe-01`–`fe-06`).
2. Keep the existing active ID formats (`WF1-...` to `WF3-...`) stable; do not add `WF4` cases.
3. Mirror every case in `01-test-cases/test-case-list.md`.
4. Record execution only in the matching Round 1, Round 2, or Round 3 cell.
   Use only `Passed`, `Failed`, `Pending`, or `N/A`.
5. Update the corresponding module row and totals in
   `02-test-statistics/test-statistics.md`. `Module code` must match the
   feature sheet's `Feature` name (`B2`).
6. Keep the current Round 1 subtotal, historical Round 1 subtotal, Round 3
   executed subtotal, and V29 subset distinct in `test-statistics.md`.
7. Before exporting, check that the number of cases, IDs, statuses, dates, and
   testers agree across all Markdown files and the workbook.
